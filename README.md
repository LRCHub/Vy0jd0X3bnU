[00:00.25] Right under my feet is air made of bricks
[00:07.23] That pulls me down, turns me weak for you
[00:12.93] I find myself repeating like a broken tune
[00:17.88] And I'm forever excusing your intentions
[00:23.75] Then, I give in to my pretendings
[00:29.35] Which forgive you each time
[00:33.87] Without me knowing
[00:36.72] They melt my heart to stone
[00:50.22] 
[00:40.11] And I hear your words that I made up
[00:45.91] You say my name like there could be an us
[00:52.24] I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
[00:59.66] I'm the only one in love
[01:11.66] 
[01:06.33] Each and every time I've turned around to leave
[01:13.52] Feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
[01:18.73] So, desperately, I try to link it with my head
[01:23.61] But instead, I fall back to my knees
[01:28.67] As you tear your way right through me
[01:35.12] I forgive you once again
[01:40.23] Without me knowing
[01:42.93] You've burnt my heart to stone
[01:57.93] 
[01:45.98] And I hear your words that I made up
[01:52.05] You say my name like there could be an us
[01:58.29] I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
[02:05.54] I'm the only one in love
[02:17.54] 
[02:11.09] Why do you steal my hand?
[02:15.57] Whenever I'm standing my own ground
[02:20.88] You build me up, and leave me there
[02:38.38] 
[02:30.88] Well, I hear your words you made up
[02:37.91] I say your name like there should be an us
[02:44.03] I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
[02:51.37] I'm the only one in love
